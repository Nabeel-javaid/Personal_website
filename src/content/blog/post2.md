## Mistake #1: Overstudying
I erroneously believed that the ONLY path to proficiency was through devouring countless roadmaps and religiously studying Secureum. However, I now understand that the balance is about 30% theoretical study and 70% practical application. In this field, practice is primarily what will lead to a consistent and positive outcome.

## Mistake #2: Overemphasis on CTF’s
A good comparison here is that a good academic is not necessarily a good practitioner. An individual “not that good” at CTF’s can be a great auditor, and there are a lot of examples of that. Instead, I should have focused more on doing some CTF’s, but also focusing on past exploits @rekt.news. Don’t get it confused: doing CTFs is good, but it’s far from what makes the most difference.

## Mistake #3: Intimidation by Huge Codebases
Tackling extensive codebases can be daunting, and there’s no quick fix. However, at least the intimidation subsides after multiple audit experiences. What I should have done is push myself as much as possible, no matter the size of the codebase. Even today, I experience initial anxiety when starting a new audit, but it usually dissipates within an hour. If you’re overwhelmed, a viable strategy is to zero in on a specific part of the codebase, temporarily ignoring the rest.

## Mistake #4: Fear of Previously Audited Protocols
Some of my biggest hits were in codebases that were previously audited. For instance, Lido underwent nine audits, each revealing new insights. A codebase that has been audited before may not contain significant logical or error bugs, but there might be overlooked edge cases—this is your opportunity to shine. Never underestimate yourself.

## Mistake #5: Lack of Discipline
I was trying to spend a lot of time. But I didn’t realize that I needed to spend quality time. Auditing requires deep work. You need to be in the flow. You need to dedicate all your mind and willpower to succeed. But the truth is, for the first few months - I didn’t. Turning off your phone, ignoring Twitter and all social media, and dedicating yourself to deep work will definitely yield you a solo high-risk finding. That’s when it started to click out for me.
